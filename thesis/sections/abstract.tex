Statically finding bugs before they can arise in production is typically known as a complex process, that is often specific to a single programming language, leading to a non-trivial implementation with specialized data-structures.
Powerful analysis tools already exists, but only for a subset of all existing languages, supporting more of them requires to re-implements the same checks again and again.
Ideally, static analysis companies would want to minimize this effort by re-using the same implementation of the different checkers.

To solve this problem, SonarSource, a company developing static analysis tool, have introduced an incomplete universal intermediate representation called \slang{}.
In this work, we are going to try to understand, consolidate, and improve the use of this universal representation to perform static analysis.
We have added the support for the functional language Scala without any big limitation, and
our experiments has shown that the implementation of a control flow based \emph{null} pointer dereference checker over the universal representation produces results that are equivalents to an implementation on the original language.
