Statically finding bugs that can arise in production is typically known as a complex process, that is often specific to a single programming language, leading to a non-trivial implementation with specialized data-structures.
Powerful analysis tools already exists, but only for a subset of all existing languages.
Supporting new language requires to re-implements the same checks again and again.
Ideally, we would want to reduce the cost by re-using the same implementation of the checker.
To solve this problem, SonarSource, a company performing static analysis, have introduce an incomplete universal intermediate representation, called \slang{}.
In this work, we are going to try to understand, consolidate, and improve the use of this universal representation to perform static analysis.
