How to Build Static Checking Systems Using Orders of Magnitude Less Code \cite{Brown:2016:BSC:2954679.2872364} is raising a similar concern that we tried to solve. 
They observed that the current situation makes it hard to target new languages due to the complexity of the current systems. 
The main idea is similar to \slang{}, they implemented a checker that is based on an incomplete grammar, that is called micro-grammars.
With this approach, they managed to implements a checker that is order of magnitude smaller that typical systems. 
They results is encouraging, they manage to find hundreds of issues with an acceptable false positive rate, with some of them that were not reported by they previous work. 
The idea is similar to island parsing, where the grammar only describe some part of a language, without requirement to have the whole syntax.
